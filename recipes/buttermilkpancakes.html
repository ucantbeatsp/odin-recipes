    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and
            pleasant chewiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness.
            Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!</li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong>Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas
            when mixed with other ingredients, causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk
            pancakes will taste bland without it.</li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk:</strong>Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for
            three whole cups.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong>Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the
            buttermilk's acidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Meltedbutter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong></em> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and
            salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong></em> Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter
            together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the
            pancakes.</li>
        <li><em><strong>Make the pancakes:</strong></em> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a
            wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and
            cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
    </ol>
