    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The peanut butter cookie recipe that most resembles modern peanut butter cookies, and introduced the now familiar
        cross-hatch pattern, first appeared in Ruth Wakefield's Toll House Tried and True Recipes in 1936. Over the
        years, similar recipes followed, including <a
            href="https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/peanut-butter-cookies/6aa18699-bad1-442a-97bf-388003acce2d">Betty
            Crocker's peanut butter cookie recipe</a>.</p>

    <p>Our recipe most closely follows Betty Crocker's proportions, but as in Ruth Wakefield's, we are using all butter
        instead of a combination of butter and shortening.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and
            fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl;
            gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls
            with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool
            completely.</li>
    </ol>
